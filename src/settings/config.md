We provide a few custom properties to configure your project.

#### Environment

Set this to either `dev` or `prod` to compile for specific environment needs.

```css
--env: dev;
```

#### Healthcheck

This draws borders around elements of different types on your design so you can see what your selector health is looking like, visually.

```css
--healthcheck: false;
```

#### Debug

This is a boolean property that lets you debug your code.

```css
--debug: false;
```
