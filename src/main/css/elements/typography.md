#### Headings

All headings are the same size from the start, so we can concentrate on semantics out of the gate without having to worry about what size the heading will be. This is better than overwriting it with more styles, or choosing the wrong semantic heading to make it look right based on what size it gives you.

```example
<h1>The quick, brown fox (20px)</h1>
```

#### Feature & Body Copy

```example:html
<div class="is-featured">
  <p>For the execution of the voyage to the Indies, I did not make use of intelligence, mathematics or maps. (24px)</p>
  <p>After having dispatched a meal, I went ashore, and found no habitation save a single house, and that without an occupant; we had no doubt that the people had fled in terror at our approach, as the house was completely furnished. (16px)</p>
</div>
```

#### Lists

```example
<ol>
  <li>This is how an ordered list looks.</li>
  <li>I am struggling to say anything more about them.</li>
  <li>That brings us to the next type of list&hellip;</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>This is how an unordered list looks.</li>
  <li>I am struggling to say anything more about them.</li>
  <li>That brings us to tiny copy&hellip;</li>
</ul>
```
