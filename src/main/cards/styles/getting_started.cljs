"# What is Untangled Stylekit?

Stylekit is a user interface library of patterns for web applications and websites built with a custom PostCSS preprocessor.



#### History of Stylekit



## What is Stylekit for?

This project is meant to suppliment your next project with a wide array of components that are styled for your HTML or
Clojurescript project. If you are using Untangled UI, you will automatically get these styles by default.

## What problem does Stylekit solve?



## What design principles underlie Stylekit?

Based on the ITCSS methodology by Harry Roberts, this project is composed by settings, elements, components, objects and
utilities and produces a stylesheet that has a healthy inclining specificity graph.

## How does Stylekit accomplish it's goals?

# Getting Started

Stylekit comes in a few different flavors to fit your needs. Please choose a flavor and follow the guide to get started.

## Components

Browse our pre-built components to get a feel for how well all of them work together.

## CSS

You can get straight to the point and get a simple CSS file with only what you need.

## PostCSS

Style like a pro with future spec-compliant CSS that lets you write variables, applys and nesting in your CSS. This is
the easiest way to modify and extend stylekit.
